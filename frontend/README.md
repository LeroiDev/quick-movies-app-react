I might add context to this small application or overkill
it with redux to expand on it a bit for practice reasons in
the future. For now I merely used a nice concept called prop drilling.
haha. Not what you want to do but necesarry to know and get familiar with basic react concepts. This Was a very quickly built small project I enjoyed.

I used the base on styling from Florin Pop.
He has a video on coding this entire application, how he structures his react code is a bit different from mine but really go watch it and build your own little movies react app. Really enjoy his content as well. Thank you Florin Pop.

Florin Pop youtube for this small applicaion - great for beginners

oof, i should probably mention as well the api used, I googled for one I don't believe there was ever the mention of which api was used however you will be able to use the links in the video with Florin Pop
I believe, I did not do so however, I got my own api key which I recommend anyone building this to do so as well. You can use it for making a Netflix clone next for example.

API-
https://themoviedatabase.org/3 was one I got and put it inside a .env to not push to github. Even if you get another one it will be good to learn at least that completely different to get famliar with how API's are accessed for frontend I think...

Most importantly have fun.
